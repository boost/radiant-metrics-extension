title: Configuring the Playground
---

Vanity will work out of the box on a default configuration.  Assuming you're using Redis on localhost, post 6379, there's nothing special to do.

If you run a different setup, use the playground object to configure Vanity.  For example:

<pre>
Vanity.playground.host = "redis.local"
Vanity.playground.password = "supersecret"
</pre>

Configuration options are:

|_. name    |_. Is all about ...                    |_. Default     |
| host      | Redis server host name                | 127.0.0.1     |
| port      | Redis server port number              | 6379          |
| db        | Redis database number                 | 0             |
| password  | Redis database password               | --            |
| namespace | Namespace for Redis keys              | vanity:1      |
| load_path | Directory containing experiment files | experiments   |
| logger    | This should be obvious                | default/Rails |
